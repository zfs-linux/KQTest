# ID: mirror_stress_003
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	running multiple copies of zfs_dataset_create_write_destroy and
#       zfs_dataset_create_write_destroy_attr on separate mirrored pools
#       shall not cause the system to fail, hang or panic.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	the setup phase will have created several mirrored pools
#	multiple copies of zfs_dataset_create_write_destroy and 
#         zfs_dataset_create_write_destroy_attr are fired off
#	  one per mirror in the background
#	Wait for our stress timeout value to finish, and kill any remaining
#       tests.
#	The test is considered to have passed if the machine stays up during the
#       time the stress tests are running and doesn't hit the stf time limit.
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2006-06-08)
